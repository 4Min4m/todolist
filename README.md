In this lab, you have learned how to manage state in a React functional component using the useState hook. State variables such as todos, headingInput, and listInput are used to maintain the state of the Todo List and user input fields.

You have learned to render headings and associated lists based on the state maintained by React's useState hook.

You have used code that implements event handling functions to add new headings and lists, and to handle changes in input fields. These functions update the state of the Todo List, triggering re-renders to reflect the changes in the UI.

You have created a Todo List component that is well-structured, with separate sections for input fields, heading display, list display, and add list functionality. This modular structure enhances code readability and maintainability.
